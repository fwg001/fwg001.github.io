<p>Intel has a commercial portraying Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, as if he was a rock star. Check it out:</p>

<p>If the web industry had it's own rock star commercial it would have to feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Meyer" target="_blank">Eric Meyer</a>. Both are well known for starting the movement to create standard practices for web sites and making sure browsers supported those standards.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zeldman is the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_blank">Web Standards Project </a>(WaSP), started <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a> and his own <a href="http://www.happycog.com/" target="_blank">studio</a>, has authored several books and lectures on the topic of web standards. He was recently called "the godfather of web standards" by <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/zine/discover-interview/jeffrey-zeldman" target="_blank">.net Magazine</a>.</li>

	<li>Meyer is famous for his standards evangelism at Netscape, authoring numerous books on CSS, and lecturing on CSS and web standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>The official web standards are maintained by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). These standards have become an integral part of professional web development, thanks to the pioneering work of Meyer and Zeldman. Standards ensure a website's audience is viewing the site as the designer intended and also provide a benchmark for quality work. Thanks rock stars, rock on!</p>
