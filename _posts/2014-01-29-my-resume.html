<h1>James Carleton</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I love creating engaging user experiences that simplifies powerful technology. When done well, the user enjoys a seamless experience, without thinking about all the work that went into it.</p>
<p>I’ve been working toward this goal most recently at Move Inc. and am ready to grow my impact in a new arena. The perfect spot for me is on a healthy creative team that can bring strong critique as well as laugh at the latest meme. I enjoy the challenge of leading the UX of a product, working closely with product and development folks as the advocate for the user. I strive to take every opportunities to grow through teammates, trainings, industry events and online resources.</p>
<p>I continually embrace emerging tools and methods to find the most effective workflow. With a background in industrial design and experience designing and developing the interwebs, I know my PNGs, PSDs, CLI, Git, IA, UI, UX and UAT. My days are lived in white board sketches, flows, wireframes, mockups, wiki pages, test results, and of course Web Inspector. I admire multi-device strategy, Design Thinking, user testing, agile dev, and Lean UX. I avoid vague meetings, hasty reactions and deadly scope creep.</p>
