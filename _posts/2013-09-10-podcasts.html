Podcasting seems to be in a phase of growth. Suddenly there are dozens of good shows about the web and creative industries. It's not a new medium so maybe the growth has been more steady and I hadn't noticed until now but I'm loving the results. I grew up with talk radio on around the house which I think gave me a special interest in listening to a good conversation. I love good music but I seem to crave podcasts more than tunes these days; call me weird. I love being able to learn something new about a design legend or discovering how the creators of a hot new app built an idea from scratch, all while driving my short commute. I end up educated, inspired, and entertained. It's a great way to bookend the workday. So without further adieu, here are my current favorites:

<h3>99% Invisible</h3>
I love this show so much that each episode seems too short. Where else am I going to learn about the guy who created the area code, an otherworldly pavilion that attract teenagers at night, or where jay walkers got their name.  If all public radio was this good, we wouldn't be debating budgets, people would gladly pay to hear it. <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99percentinvisible.org</a> | <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318">iTunes</a>

<img class="alignright" alt="Happy Monday" src="/assets/posts/happymonday.png" width="132" height="132" />
<h3>Happy Monday</h3>
There is no better way to start your Monday than with a short burst of inspiration from Josh Long and Sarah Parmenter and their guests. <a href="http://happymondaypodcast.com/" target="_blank">happymondaypodcast.com</a> | <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/happy-monday/id586131811?mt=2" target="_blank">iTunes</a>

<img class="alignright" alt="execute" src="/assets/posts/execute.png" width="132" height="132" />
<h3>Execute</h3>
Jealous of those people who think of a product idea and then just make it happen? It doesn't take special powers, just read <a href="http://executebook.com/" target="_blank">Execute</a> and then listen to the Execute podcast and you'll be that person in no time. Maybe I should execute my own podcast. <a href="http://executebook.com/" target="_blank">Execute</a> <a href="theindustry.cc/2013/04/05/execute-podcast-1-oak-studios/" target="_blank">theindustry.cc</a> | <a href="http://itun.es/i6JW5Dd" target="_blank">iTunes</a>

<h3>The Big Web Show</h3>
As the Godfather of the Web, Jeffery Zeldman can get an interview with anyone. I met "Mr Ziggy" once and although his stature is small, his knowledge is larger than life. I took a picture if you want to see it. :) <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/" target="_blank">The Big Web Show</a> | <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow" target="_blank">Archives on 5by5</a> | <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=370445683&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A" target="_blank">iTunes</a>
