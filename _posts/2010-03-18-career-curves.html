Sometimes I'm jealous of people who choose a career in 5th grade and then follow a well worn path to 'succes'. Mostly though, I'm glad that's not me. Like my work, my career path has been far more creative than that.

I thought I would write about how my focus has changed in the last few months. Close friends know the <em>back story</em>, but recently my employment ended. It's not the best time to find a similar position so I decided to start my own company. Guess what? I'm now a building designer! Well I was before, but now I work for myself. Plus I have to run the rest of the business. 

I'm also still a web/graphic designer at your service, but most of my time is spent drafting.
