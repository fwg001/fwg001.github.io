I’ve been working on focus. We live in a world of distractions and it’s way too easy to lose time to things that are in front of us instead of what’s a real priority. <!--more-->Smart devices have multiplied and so have their power to get our attention. Each notification is a clever pull for your attention. You have new messages, you have an appointment tomorrow, someone likes something. Sure it’s great to be informed, but it’s killing my focus. Why am I acting like each notification is a critical situation requiring my immediate and full attention? Instead of responding to a text/email/im/whatever, I should be considering its priority and dealing with it at the right time. If I immediately respond, I’m moving it to the top of my list. Is it more important than what I was doing? Sometimes it may be, but most of the time it’s just a distraction. I owe my friends/family/employer better focus. So, I’m striving to be disciplined instead of distracted.
