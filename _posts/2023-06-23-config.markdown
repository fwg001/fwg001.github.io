## Config2023
I had a great time at Figma's annual Config conference June 21-23, 2023. This year it was huge! 8k+ fans at Moscone Center San Francisco and many more watching virtually.<!--more-->
The kick off was a great keynote revealing some mind blowing new features for design systems (tokens/variables), prototyping, and dev mode. Later sessions included really practical advice for designers on a wide range of topics as well as some deeply personal stories that challenged our brains and hearts. 
I was joined by my teammate Vivek Gupta in person and the rest of our team was watching virtually. It was pretty amazing to see so many people excited about a design tool getting together and connecting over this common interest.

## Looking back
The company and userbase has grown so much in the past few years. Back in  August 2019, when Figma was a baby compay, I took this pic of their first major ad, a billboard in SF. Now itâ€™s all grown up and packing 8k friends into Moscone center at #Config2023 .

Congrats Figma team!
