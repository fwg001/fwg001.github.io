<p>Friends have asked how to get started learning web development. The good news is that it's pretty simple to get started building websites. Like anything, it takes a lot more time to develop your skill to a professional level. Here are a few resources to get anyone started in the right direction.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">W3 Schools</a></strong> is a comprehensive guide to web codes. Guided lessons and quick reference for html and css makes this very helpful tool for newbies and pros. </p>

<strong>Editors</strong>
<p>There are a wide variety of HTML editors but your can start with any simple program like Notepad or TextEdit. More elaborate programs such a Dreamweaver can write code for you but such WYSIWYG applications can slow down your learning and become a crutch. Although simple to use, the code they generate is often not semantic or efficient. I suggest learning to do it yourself, the time investment will pay off in better results.</p>

<strong>W3C</strong>
<p>Once you get into the code how to you know your doing it right? Easily check your programming with W3C's <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">html</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">css</a> validators. These tools check your code against the official standards and even suggests improvements.</p>

<strong>Books</strong>
<p>There are countless books that can guide you through development of a simple sample site. I recommend getting books by experts in the industry: Jeffery Zeldman, Eric Meyer, Dan Cederholm, Jeremy Keith, and others. (I'm working on a specific list.)</p>

<p>Once you get started you can follow blogs such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nettuts</a>, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smashing mag</a>, <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">.net mag</a>, and more to keep up with the latest techniques.</p>

<p>Have fun! Start with a project you're really excited about, instead of the one thats due tomorrow.</p>
