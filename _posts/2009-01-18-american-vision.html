I'm currently collaborating with Elias at <a title="AVW" href="http://www.americanvisionwindows.com/" target="_blank">American Vision Windows</a> (plus Kitchens &amp; Baths) to create a power point presentation for their sales team. His goal is to provide the team with better tools to quickly communicate the uniqueness of their company to potential clients. For example: AVW's mission is,“to revolutionize the home improvement industry one customer at a time, while changing the lives of our employees for the better.” It's not often a company focuses its success on its own employees instead of its bottom line. The in-home appointment requires our presentation to be quick, clear, and effective. To facilitate the wide audience of the presentation, we will be organizing the presentation so the salesperson can quickly jump to various sections as needed, instead of following a fixed path through the information.
