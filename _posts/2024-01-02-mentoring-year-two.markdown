title: Mentoring Year In Review 2
---
It seems like I just shared my recap of [mentoring in 2022](/2023/01/06/mentoring-year-in-review/) but now it’s time to reflect on 2023.

## Mentoring on ADPlist.org

I had another great year mentoring designers on ADPlist.org. I met with a wide range of folks from experienced pros to students just entering design profession. As the job market was constrained lots of our time was focused on how to break into the industry. I don’t have an easy answer. I think it’s a mix of endurance, demonstrating skill, and making personal connections. As the market changes, we need to be nimble and creative in how we find work.

## BeMore Conference speaker

Once again a big highlight was [speaking at the BeMore conference](http://www.carletondesign.com/2023/09/20/stand-out/) about standing out in a crowded job market.

## My 2023 Wrapped

ADPList provided this *wrapped* graphic with my stats. Like last year, I want to share it as inspiration for others to start mentoring. We need more great mentors to share their wisdom with the community. Try dedicating just an hour a week and soon you will be hooked on giving back.

Come try it yourself at [ADPlist.org](http://www.adplist.org/)
