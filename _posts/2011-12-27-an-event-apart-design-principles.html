<em>This is part of a series of posts summarizing my notes from the extraordinary conference <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a>, held December 12-14, 2011 at The Palace Hotel in San Francisco.</em>

<strong>Design Principles</strong>

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> - Author

<strong>Description</strong>

All software is inherently political, reflecting the biases and beliefs of the people behind it. These beliefs can be made explicit through the publication of design principles: pragmatic rules of thumb that underpin a shared endeavor. Find out how important good design principles are to any project, whether it’s a website, a framework, or the World Wide Web itself.

<strong>Quotes</strong>
<blockquote>Design Principle: Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept (ex. forgiving input forms)</blockquote>
<blockquote>HTML5 degradation is like Inception in your browser.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Design principles are not about pleasing everybody. Pick a side and plant your flag.</blockquote>
<strong>Notes</strong>

<strong>Design Principles</strong>
*Principles, Goals, and Patterns*
* Design Principles are the tenets for a project. They help create consensus, determine the best approach to a problem.
** Design Goals -&gt; Why?
** Design Principles -&gt; How?
** Design Patterns -&gt; What?
** These influence each other
<blockquote>Pretty much any endeavor in human history has had this pattern of design goals, principles, and patterns.</blockquote>
** You can't prevent your philosophies from showing in your work.
<blockquote>Software, like all technologies, is inherently political. Code inevitably reflects the choices, biases and desires of its creators. -Jamais Cascio</blockquote>
Web &amp; Design Principles
* Emergent design principles of the web: Rough consensus and running code
* The Web is agreement, bottom-up effort
* CSS core pattern
<code>selector {property:value;}</code>
** fail proof - skips unknown elements
* Principle: fault tolerant behavior, allows evolution of patterns
<blockquote>Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept.</blockquote>
HTML5 &amp; Design Principles
* Compatibility, utility, interoperability
* Browser graceful degradation allows quick adoption of new features
* Input types - hints mobile browsers to use keyboard types
* Browser Goal: Backward compatibility
* Design Principle: Progressive enhancement (connected to graceful degradation)
* Ex: HTML5 Video - video tag can contain code to a flash movie as a fallback.
<blockquote>Levels of fallback in html5 is like inception in your browser</blockquote>
*Javascript &amp; Design Principles*
* Metcalf's law
bq. The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users in the system.
* Javasrcript is everywhere. Competitors fight Metcalf's law.
* Unobtrusive Javascript: chose a framework based on philosophy
* Jquery: find stuff, do stuff to it.
** ex: star rating input actually a form selector instead of links. Selector is transformed into linked starts with js.
** Look for fundamental task
** Look at anti-patterns.
* Principles can be informed by goals that are malicious. You can develop designs that are likewise malicious.
** ex: Rynair used a cookie to double the fair price on a return visit.
* Not about pleasing everyone

Big picture Principles
* Goals lead down to principles; principles lead down to patterns.
* Fewer principles help focus the task.
* Pareto Principle.
<blockquote>Design for the 80%</blockquote>
** Instead of solving for everything, aim for the bigger group
* Support universal access - principles that bring life to websites that work across all devices.
