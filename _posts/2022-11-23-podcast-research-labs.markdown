### My first podcast!

I had to jump on here during my Thanksgiving break ðŸ¦ƒ to share some fun news...

I'm the guest on the latest episode of the Research Lab Podcast by [SundayPyjamas](https://sundaypyjamas.com/) with [Nishi Panchal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAw6EREBWzBNaxnmnsVf985wSe2m9PNajAY). ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Or listen to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app.

We covered a lot of ground, from the basics of Design Systems to my hot take on the Figma acquisition and lots in between.

Thanks to Nishi for making the process so easy and comfortable for my first try at podcasting. I hope everyone enjoys the conversation and hopefully, you hear something useful in there. It was a fun and inspiring opportunity.
