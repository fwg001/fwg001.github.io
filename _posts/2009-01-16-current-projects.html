I'm currently in the process of creating <a title="James Carleton Design" href="http://CarletonDesign.com" target="_self">CarletonDesign.com</a> (this blog is part of it) as my new portfolio site to replace <a title="JRCID" href="http://jrcid.com" target="_blank">jrcid.com</a>.

I can't wait to convert the design to CSS/HTML so I can insert the new content. I have some great ideas. Now that the design concept is settled, I'm finalizing textures and colors.

I also have been working with Eric at <a title="E&amp;J" href="http://www.eandjdesign.com/" target="_blank">E &amp; J Design</a> on the next version of <a title="LEEDstudy" href="http://LEEDstudy.com" target="_blank">LEEDstudy.com</a>. Check out that design, it's still a work in progress.
