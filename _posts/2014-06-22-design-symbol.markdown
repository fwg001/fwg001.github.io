Thinking about the design process for a set of icons I'm working on, I realized it felt very familiar. Icons are a great analogy for design as a whole. 

* A good icon is simple, clear, and almost obvious.
* A good icon hides the effort and skill that led to its existence. 
* A good icon doesn't make you think.
* A good icon spans context and culture.

Ditto for *UI/UX/interaction/web/app/logo/branding/product/etc* design.
