Sometimes the internet feels like a dumpster fire but once in a while it feels like the pinnacle of human accomplishment. When I find a specific niche source of knowledge that piques my interest in just the right way it can be amazing. <!--more--> If you share my love of learning how things work, the technical details of design, or the history of technology I have a golden nugget for you. It‚Äôs a great reminder that consuming well crafted stories is a thousand times better than scrolling through endless cat videos.

[Marcin Wichary](https://aresluna.org/) is a design director at Figma who you may know from [Config 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDI8ubVZi7w). He has crafted a beautifully written and illustrated article that goes deep into the history of a nameless font used on everything mechanical from elevators to typewriter keys. I recommend taking time to slowly absorb the essay, photos and interactive illustrations.
