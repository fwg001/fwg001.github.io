There is a famous wooden roller coaster, [The Giant Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Dipper), built-in 1924 at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk that still entertains visitors today. The classic up-and-down action is enough to thrill you every time. 

Like this roller coaster, there are many ups and downs in building a design system at a corporate scale.
