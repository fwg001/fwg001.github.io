<p>After two nights of intense design and development, a new site has been released for E&amp;J Design, a collaboration between Eric Ritchey and myself. Nothing like a deadline to motivate! We're stoked to have it live, but have more in the works for the future. Take it for a spin: <a href="http://eandjdesign.com/" target="_new">www.eandjdesign.com</a></p>
