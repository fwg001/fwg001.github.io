title:  Crooked Path
---
Creative people often have a story to tell about the adventurous path to where they ended up. I love hearing them talk about the crooked path toward success. Finding your creative calling and matching it to a sustainable career is a creative exercise in itself. It often starts with a naive student studying a traditional vocation, living in a coma of certainty. One day this student serendipitously stumbles into a rabbit hole that opens their eyes to a new world of possibilities. After some self discovery, trial and error, and a lucky break, the student creates a new goal and works hard to reach it. Soon they are living their creative dream and their hidden talent is revealed to the adoring world.

The creative field is full of people who started down one path but ended up on another. Mechanical Engineers transformed into design evangelists. Librarians reclassified as information architects. English lit grad students now editing paint on canvas. Dentists turned landscape photographers. What is it about creativity that is so easily overlooked when careers are prescribed? Try as we might, we can only ignore it for so long, that creativity often finds its way out. The result is a crooked path, and a great story to tell.
