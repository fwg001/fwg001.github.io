PDF form design (SOTS)
I love PDFs. They are a great way to share documents but also have many other uses such as slideshows, design presentations and interactive forms. In order to provide a client with a method for editing text on a graphic layout, I recently created a PDF form from a design layout. I was able to provide the client with one PDF design layout of a cd case booklet that could eaisily be endited with a free PDF viewer so the client could print a layout with customized text for each version of their cd. This solution saved the client's  small business the time and cost of creating new cd layouts for each iteration of it's product.
