I love exploring new avenues for creativity. After years of working on stationary pixels it was great to play with some moving pixels for a change. I just completed a video project. Here is the story... 

I've been working with the owner of a local prototyping shop for many years on their various branding and marketing efforts. They transform drawings from engineers into realistic product prototypes made of metals and plastics. So a conversation about their website redesign project sparked an interesting idea about video. It sounded like a great format to express the character of the company and its value to potential clients. 

I knew exactly who to contact. My talented friend and photographer [Manus Chau](http://www.manuschauphotography.com/weblog/) was perfect for the job. 

We jumped in with a lively brainstorming session with the client, and came out with the green light for the project. As usual, we started with design goals. It had to be succinct, it had to describe their range of services and it had to be engaging enough to keep the viewer entertained. We sketched storyboards to plan out each shot of the employees, facility, and its capabilities. Then we developed interview questions and detailed shot lists to prepare for the shoot.

Action! Two photographers, two cameras, one hovering producer, and one client was ready. We staged exciting shots of the machinery with many angles and takes. Watch out for flying shrapnel. We interviewed key staff to showcase the companies' services.  Nerves were overcome and personalities emerged. After the scripted parts we also recorded the natural movement of the busy facility.

In the editing process, we whittled down the pile of raw footage into a cohesive message. The story reveals the owner's passion for the craft and his business. It touches on the close knit culture and the skillful hands that get things done every day. Footage of the working facility compliments the staff interviews and helps explain the spoken words. Action shots like chips of aluminum flying across a milling machine, or molten plastic filling up a mold, add a level of excitement to the story. With the addition of background music and supporting graphics, the video came to life. Then we shared our newborn with the world.

I learned stuff, I had fun, and the client loves it. It was a great opportunity to collaborate with and learn from creative friends. The experience reminded me of how much fun it is to dabble in a new arena of art and design. So what's next? Anyone want to commission a painting?
