Branding is the process of creating a visual identity for a company/product/ service/person. The face of a business is it's brand. It's appears on a wide range of media: cards, letterhead, packaging, vehicles, signs, apparel,buildings, websites, ads.
Creating a brand takes passion and planning. Entreprnuers often try to name their business and design their identity without getting external input. If you are your own target user this may work. In most cases using outside help and at least some market research can help create a brand that is much more meaningful and appealing to the target market.
