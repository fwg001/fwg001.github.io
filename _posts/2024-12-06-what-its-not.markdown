title: A design system is not…
---
- a UI kit
- a sticker sheet
- a component library
- a brand book
- a code library<!--more-->
- design tokens
- usage guidelines
- one size fits all
- generic, off-the-shelf, prebuilt

A design system CAN contain these things, but it’s much more than these parts.

## So, what is a design system then?

An effective design system is about people working together to support its company/organization.

- It should be collaborative by folks across org roles and specialties
- It should grow and adapt to the changing needs of its org
    - Startups have different needs than megacorps
- It should be customized to your product space
    - Retail, e-commerce, fintech, consumer, b2b - these have much different product needs
- The term *Design* shouldn’t even be leading the name. Calling it something like *Product systems* would help clarify the purpose and be more inclusive to partners outside the design org.
    - Engineering, product, brand, content, research, ops, all these departments should be involved to various degrees at different phases of the system’s maturity.

## If your ‘design system’ is only a figma file, stop calling it one.

- A concept of a system is not yet a system.
- Make it a collaboration, build with engineers from the start, otherwise it's just hopes and dreams
- Make it custom, it should be tailored to your product/org not generic
- Don’t try to tackle it all from the start, mature the system as needed. Tokens can come later, documentation can start simple, iterate.
- Work to connect people first, then start building together.

## Remember that a system is about people.
