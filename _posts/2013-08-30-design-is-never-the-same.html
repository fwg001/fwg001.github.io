title: Design is never the same
---
<p>Design is a chameleon and I love it. One day <em>design</em> is a piece of paper with text, a moment later <em>design</em> is an ephemeral atmospheric expression. There is so much in the world that craves thoughtful arrangement that the need for <em>design</em> is endless and dynamic.</p>

<p>My niche of design is especially volatile. The web changes every second, and as the technologies evolve so must the designer. This forces designers to be excellent at adapting, ready to jump on an idea before we really know what’s involved. Frank reminded me of this today:
<blockquote>I learned to make websites because I agreed to do something that I didn’t know how to do and then I had to figure out how to do it. That seems to be a pattern…because nobody knows how to do what was invented last week. You have to say you know how, then figure it out under the gun.</blockquote> - Frank Chimero via <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/frank-chimero">The Great Discontent</a></p>
