<p>What do you think of when you see a beaker full of unknown liquids? Scientific experimentation comes to mind. I've noticed a rise in logos and illustrations which contain scientific symbols, such as beakers or test tubes, used to represent the experimental qualities of web/software companies. Here are a few examples that work well:</p>

I like the idea of borrowing the symbols from a traditional field to represent something new in technology. I used the term 'lab' as part of a name for a friend's new <a title="Ames CoLab" href="http://amescolab.com/" target="blank">co-working space</a> and love how it symbolizes groundbreaking ideas in action.</p>
