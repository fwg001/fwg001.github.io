<p>Thinking about the design process for a set of icons I’m working on, I realized it felt very familiar. Icons are a great analogy for design as a whole.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A good icon is simple, clear, and almost obvious.</li>
  <li>A good icon hides the effort and skill that led to its existence.</li>
  <li>A good icon doesn’t make you think.</li>
  <li>A good icon spans context and culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ditto for <em>UI/UX/interaction/web/app/logo/branding/product/etc</em> design.</p>
