##  Clarity Conference 2022


This year I (virtually) attended [Clarity Conference](https://www.clarityconf.com/), the premier design system conference, with my teammate [Silvia Recinos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvia-recinos/). 

I’ve captured my favorite lessons from two days full of great design systems knowledge.

## Day 1 - Morning

It's that time of year when Design System folks gather together at Clarity Conference.

This morning was filled with great talks by [Dan Mall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAz1REBg5gKvwXd_QmnaZnSWxtoudBhHGk), [Amy Hupe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA5LpbYBK1uzgnSuMK1biUyo4y6N2U5tmQ0), and [Anna Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA4obc8B9VprAhhfIdiB-RcRDGhdzkecS9w).
