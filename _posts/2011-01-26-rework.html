I hardly shout at all, but I have to make an exception. GET THIS BOOK!!!!!! Seriously!

Rework, by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson is a must-read. I won't try to summarize it, you need to experience every word. I will note some of my favorite parts:
<blockquote>"Workaholics aren’t heroes. They don’t save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is already home because she figured out a faster way to get things done." </blockquote>
<blockquote>"Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Interruption is the enemy of productivity. The worst interruptions of all are meetings. Meetings are toxic."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"When everything needs constant approval, you create a culture of non-thinkers."</blockquote>
There is so much more, you just have to read it. It's general enough that anyone with a job can apply it but it also has specific wisdom for those starting a new venture. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/sets/72157623458720373/with/4418288411/"  target="_blank" rel="nofollow">amazing artwork</a> by Mike Rohde is the icing on this cake of business wisdom. Yum.
