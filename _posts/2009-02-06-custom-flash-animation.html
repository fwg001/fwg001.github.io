I recently completed an elaborate flash animation now online at <a title="End Fossil Fuels" href="http://endfossilfuels.com" target="_blank">endfossilfuels.com</a> (see "What is a Carbon Offset?"). Working with a script developed by my client at <a title="Comcast Spotlight SF" href="http://sf.comcastspotlight.com/sites/default.aspx?siteid=109" target="_blank">Comcast Spotlight SF</a>, I developed a set of themed icons which were animated to narration and sound effects. The resulting animation is an effective sales tool which educates website visitors about carbon offsets.
