**PROJECT OVERVIEW (tl;dr)**

* Designed a map system for the Realtor.com, our flagship real estate search product in 2015-16. 
* Includes maps for homes, real estate agents, neighborhoods and schools.
* My role was lead UX Designer for the map system, spanning many products and teams.
* It's not all public yet, so I can't share details here. Lets talk in person :)

**FULL STORY**

Realtor.com is the flagship product of Move Inc. and the original site for online real estate (50 million UUs/month). It's map view of the search results page has gone through several iterations in recent years and features came and went. It came time for our design team to define a complete map system to set a vision for the product that could be built iteratively. 

The map system addressed a wide range of map aspects including:

* Pins styling and interaction
* Data density and performance concerns
* Constrained polygon search
* Base map styling
* Draw tools
* Saved items
* Consumer media and amenity integrations
* Data layers like crime, commute, pollution

This project was quite complex, and I have lots more to share.
