**PROJECT OVERVIEW (tl;dr)**

* Designed a map system for the Realtor.com, our flagship real estate search product in 2015-16. 
* Includes maps for home search, professional search, neighborhood and school info on responsive desktop and native apps.
* My role was lead UX Designer for the map system, spanning many products and teams.
* It's not all public yet, so I can't share details here. Lets talk in person :)


**LESSONS LEARNED**

* Coordinating a wide range of people in different roles takes time.

**FULL STORY**

Realtor.com is the flagship product of Move Inc. and the original site for online real estate (50 million UUs/month). It's map view of the search results page has gone through several iterations in recent years and features came and went. It came time for our design team to define a complete map system to set a vision for the product that could be built iteratively. 

Note: My design work is not yet public.
