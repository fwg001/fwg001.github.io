**Summary**
Redesigned our flagship real estate search product for a new responsive front end in 2015. Took the opportunity to update styling and design patterns. We needed to maintain or improve all business measures for our 50M users each month. My role was UX Designer (Visual & Interaction) collaborating with two other designers. I lead design for the search results and map experiences.
