*Description*

SeniorHousingNet.com is a product of Realtor.com/Move Inc. specific to senior living facility listings. It may not get notoriety around the office, but it’s a pretty big deal in this growing market segment.

Instead of embracing the status quo, this small team decided to make big waves. We aimed to blaze a new trail with a responsive redesign, the first use in the company history. Looking back, it seems obvious but at the time it was risky. Our mobile usage numbers were small but growing, especially on tablets. A few months earlier I had attended AEA and soaked up everything LukeW said about mobile. This proved to be great timing, since we jumped into creating a dual template responsive redesign for our *community pages* that brought a great experience to both desktop and mobile users.

On top of designer, I became the RWD tech resource and mobile device QA tester. The risk paid off and soon our mobile usage was climbing and our clients were happy. We’re now in the process of applying the same principles to the rest of the site, and we’re sharing our lessons with other teams across the company. Using creative thinking and hard work our small team has made a big impact.
