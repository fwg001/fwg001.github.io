**PROJECT OVERVIEW (tl;dr)**

- Hackathon project in Jan '16. 
- We had two days to create a 'startup' idea and present it for internal judging. 
- I collaborated with teammate Juan Pablo Costanzo to design, prototype, and present a concierge home search app. 
- We called it Ni:dle

**LESSONS LEARNED**

Hackathons are a great way to explore a fresh idea. The time constraint provides intense focus and teaches quick decision making skills. I loved the chance to learn Principle App, which enabled us to demonstrate the concept as if it was coded, complete with animated transitions.

**NEWS**

Of ~50 hacks, we won the trophy for product innovation! üèÜ üéâ
