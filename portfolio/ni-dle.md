**PROJECT OVERVIEW (tl;dr)**
Hackathon project in Jan '16. We had two days to create a 'startup' idea and present it for internal judging. I collaborated with teammate Juan Pablo Costanzo to design, prototype, and present a concierge home search app. We called it Ni:dle 

**LESSONS LEARNED**
Hackathons are a great way to explore a fresh idea. The time constraint provides intense focus and teaches quick decision making skills. I loved the chance to learn Principle App, which enabled us to demonstrate the concept as if it was coded, complete with animated transitions.

**NEWS **
Of 50 hacks, we won the trophy for product innovation.
