*Description*

Realtor.com is the flagship product of Move Inc. and the original site for online real estate. It's map view of the search results page was ready for an upgrade. The Bing platform had evolved and so had user expectations. This project upgraded the map platform behind the scenes as well as provided new features an layout to the front end.

My role was as UX designer supporting a Principle UX designer by developing visual and interaction specs for the many elements of the new design. By collaborating across teams I was able to build a cohesive system of related treatments for the many types of property *pins* and *cards*. The rich interactions were refined using prototype testing in our user research lab.
