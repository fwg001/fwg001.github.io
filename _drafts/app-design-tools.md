I’ve recently started a native app design project and it has been fun to experiment with new tools. Here are my favorites:

*[LiveView](http://www.zambetti.com/projects/liveview/)* lets you display anything from your computer onto your iPhone/iPad. You can overlay it on your Photoshop file and boom your design is on your iOS device screen. This is great for visual tests like font size, touch target sizes, and color contrast. I’ve used it for responsive design projects as well.

*[Flinto](https://www.flinto.com/)* is a great app for making a super quick interactive prototype from your wireframes. You just add your image files and then easily add hot spots for navigation, select transitions and setup fixed headers/footers. It works on iOS/Android phones/tablets and is amazingly intuitive to use. The benefits of seeing your early design concepts on the device, with realistic interaction are huge. It enables better user flow, navigation and interaction decisions at the beginning of a project, instead of waiting dev to make it real and then discovering issues.
