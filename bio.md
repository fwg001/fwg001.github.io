## About

I have lead big changes that start with small details using design systems and accessibility. These critical details add up to large impacts on the experiences we build for our end customers. Collaboration is the thread I use to build strong culture and productive teamwork.

I love working with creative individuals that can bring strong critique as well as laugh at the latest meme. I thrive on the challenge of leading interaction and visual design efforts with product and development staff toward results that meet business and UX goals. I jump at the opportunity to grow through teammates, trainings, industry events and resources.
