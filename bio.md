## About

I have led big changes that start with small details using design systems and accessibility. These critical details add up to make a big impact on the experiences we build for our end customers. Collaboration is the thread I use to build a strong culture and productive teamwork.

## Experience

launch, first launched to internal teams and then to the public. See [playbook.ebay.com](https://playbook.ebay.com)
- Collaborated across disciplines (design, engineering, accessibility, content, brand) to build
new components in Figma, native iOS/Android, and web libraries to support product teams.
- Led DS support efforts for our adopting product teams with frequent office hours, Slack channels, and direct collaborations.

**2019 to 2024 - PayPal Inc. - Sr. User Experience Designer 2, Design Systems & Accessibility**
