<h1 id="realtorcom-pattern-library">Realtor.com Pattern Library</h1>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
* I collected all of our design patterns for Realtor.com and organized them into a library file so everyone could easily leverage a set of coordinated in our source format, Sketch.
* This was a huge benefit for our design team in efficiency and brought a new perspective to our overall work.</p>

<p><strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong>
* Patterns are a vital tool for a design team.
* I wrote about the benefits of patterns <a href="">here</a>.
* Creating a collection of your design patterns enables a powerful view of the overall system, which leads to better perspective when working on individual parts.</p>

<p><strong>PROJECT STORY</strong>
I love trying new design tools and processes. I end up getting the software questions from my teammates. I’m not an expert, but I enjoy the challenge of learning new tools and sharing those skills with my teammates. If an issue arrises I can usually figure out a solution. 
Earlier this year our UX design team switch completely from Photoshop to Sketch. As we got used to Sketch, we noticed how useful pre-set styles and symbols were for speeding up our work. After demonstrating these advantages and the potential benefit to the team, management was interested. 
I was tasked with collecting and organizing the design patterns used on our Realtor.com product, primarily from the <a href="http">Responsive Redesign</a> project. So I systematically collected and organized these patterns, in Sketch format, and organized them using the Atomic system to create our Pattern Library file, aka ‘sticker sheet’.</p>

<p>[atomic pic]</p>

<p>This was an instant success for our team. Even the first draft with limited patterns was useful to team members. Several versions later, we are now all able to quickly grab our standard parts and compose a mockup in record speed. 
Instead of wasting time re-designing a form or wondering what dimension a listing card should be, we just cut/paste from the pattern library. As our styles and patterns evolve for new projects, the library will evolve along side. 
In addition to the efficiency gain, the team also gained a new perspective by being able to view all of our patterns together. Previously we had partial documentation of styles and patterns but it quickly became obsolete so we stopped referring to them. This pattern library is flexible enough to be kept current with minimal effort. Now one document can provide the overview of our design patterns so each designer knows the context for their work. 
Next we would like to document interactive and motion design elements in a similar fashion.</p>
