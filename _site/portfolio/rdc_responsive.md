Two teammates on this project, Joyce Leung and Jeremy Taylor, were interviewed about the project on the [Responsive Web Design Podcast](http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/) with Ethan Marcotte and Karen McGrane. If you know RWD this is kind of a big deal ðŸ˜Š!
 
*PROJECT STORY*
Realtor.com's desktop optimized website has been successful for many years. As mobile exploded and we developed industry leading native apps, a gap appeared between these two experiences. This disconnect  was a disservice to users of tablets and mobile devices. There were also SEO and engineering maintenance benefits to moving to a responsive front end.

Collaborating with our UX Dev teammates, we began planning to transform our existing desktop experience into a flexible and adaptive site that would work across devices, and would eliminate the need for our mobile (m-dot) site. Responsive design would provide a consistent experience for users and reduce engineering overhead that's needed for separate mobile and desktop sites.

To make this big goal happen we designed and built a new responsive framework, based on Bootstrap 3. We documented grids, breakpoints, and patterns. In collaboration with Product Management, we mapped out every piece of content that would be rebuilt and decided what content could be removed, then we ordered the priority of content.

Our core real estate search product consist of 3 parts, Homepage, Search Results and Detail pages. I led the Search Results UX, which includes the listing result page, the search filters (faceted search), and maps ([details over here](/portfolio/rdc_maps)). My teammates, Jeff Boissier and Paulus Trisnadi, led the homepage and property detail pages respectively.
